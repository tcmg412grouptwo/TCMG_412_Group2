One of the Four Pillars of Effective Devops, Affinity, is the process of building interteam relationships, navigating differing goals, fostering empathy and learning between different goups of people. If Devops is a culture, then Affinity is the measurement of the team. 

Like computer systems, relationships with people require work to maintain. Affinity, also called relationship work, is another type of work in a Devops environment. Good relationships with other must be maintained often and can be influenced by internal and external forces. One common internal factor in a group is the balance between stability and change. Some members may prioritize stability and seek to keep things the same while others may be more of a risk taker and may seek to change things for the better. Internal forces usually pull members of a team away from each other, but external forces typically push the entire group in one direction. External forces can come from other teams, such as competition for rewards or shared resources. These conflicts usually test the teams internal cohesion as they can destroy the team or make it stronger.
