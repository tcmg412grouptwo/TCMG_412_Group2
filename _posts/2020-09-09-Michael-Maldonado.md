![DevOps]

When speaking of devops it's important to include the misconceptions because this allows us to understand what the concept is not and also what to stray away from as an organization. Too many times you see organizations allow certain actions because the output of productivity is still high, but in the long run these actions may have a negative effect on the organization and trickle down to the teams. 
One main misconception is that devops is "A team". The whole goal of devops is to coincide the development and operations groups to work together seamlessly. Now you can title this change as new "Team", but this really is just a statement. To make this change actually have an effect and see performance through the Dev and Ops collaboration you need to change the environment and culture. One specific way to accomplish this change is by identifying and implementing clear roles and responsibilities for each team so they can seamlessly work in growing the company.

Another misconception is that there is only "one specific" way to accomplish devops. There is no specific blueprint that works for every company when it comes to DevOps and actually it's encouraged to have critical thinking processes, tools, and practices that relate to your company. As an organization you have to think critically and always be open to learning new ways of updating your system to work the most efficient and effective way possible. 

Lastly, there's another misconception that DevOps is all about tools. Tools do play a huge part in the process, but devops itself does not require any specific tools. Like I said in the first paragraph the whole idea of devops is changing the culture within which you were and analyzing which tools could be changed to positively impact the outputs. No matter if you're a startup or an established cooperation there will be tools that can be implemented and work great for what your company needs to run efficiently and effectively. It's just a matter of researching and implementing that CULTURE to have the outcome you desire as a company.
