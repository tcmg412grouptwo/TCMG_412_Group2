title: DevOps vs Dev Ops

Some differences of having Dev Ops together and seperate.

Having Development & Operations teams separated has caused some problems in today's world. The Development team is in their own world and everyone is happy doing their own thing. On the other hand Operations might be really struggling trying to understand the work being done from the Dev team. There would always be something going wrong.

Having Development & Operations in one big team helps when it comes to communication. The entire team will see the project through its build, release, and monitor phases. This helps the team to be able to goback into coding and fix exatly what was causing issues instead of having the operstions team tell the development team what to fix.

The new Dev Ops collaboration is more efficient and allows for better communication amongst its teams.
