A Small Piece of What Collaboration is in DevOps

Collaboration is one of the four pillars of DevOps. According to **Effective DevOps**, collaboration is the process of building  toward a specific outcome through the interactions, input, and support of multuple people. An example of this would be *pair programming* which is where two people are working on the exact same piece of code at the exact same time.
Some other examples include:
* Asynchronous code review
* Documentation 
* Updating issues and bug reports
* Demonstrating weekly progress
* Regular status updates
* Pairing

The benefit of having a very diverse teams is that there are going to be different view points and experiences that can help aid in finding the best possible solution a team can find. With a diverse team, there are different levels of creativity, problem solving, and productivity so there will be some conflicts, but as long as everyone has a mutual respect towards each team member, then this can help build mutual understading and resolve possible conflicts.

By having a diverse team doesn't necessarily mean having more women or difference races on a team, even though these are some ways to make a team more diverse another factor are people's cognitive styles. Cognitive style is how people think about things, how they learn and understand information, and how they mentally engage with their work, environment, and others. 
Some difference key styles include:
* Introvert, ambivert, and extrovert
* Asker vs. guesser
* Starter vs. finisher
* Analytical, critical, and lateral thinkers
* Purist vs. pragmatist

All of these different styles can keep a team well-balanced. For example, if a team is composed of only starters, then this team will have good ideas for projects but won't be able to finish projects in the sense of typing up loose ends and fixing any remaining issues. Vice versa, if a team is composed of only finishers, then the team is good at tying up loose ends and fixing any problems, but they will have some sort of trouble coming up with ideas.

Even though this is just a small portion of what kinds of collaborations there are in IT, just remember: diversity is a good thing because of the ability to push teams to grow and be the best they can be possible.
